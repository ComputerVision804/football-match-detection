# ⚽ Football Player Detection with YOLOv8 

This project uses a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect football players from live camera feeds or video files. It includes extended features such as action recognition, team classification, goal event highlighting, and player heatmap generation — all presented through a user-friendly..

## 🌟 Features

- 🎥 **Live Camera Detection**  
  Detect players and analyze their behavior in real-time using your webcam.

- 📹 **Video Detection**  
  Upload a pre-recorded football match and analyze each frame.

- 🤖 **Action Recognition** *(placeholder)*  
  Classify actions like passing, shooting, or running.

- 🟥🟦 **Team-Based Classification** *(placeholder)*  
  Identify and differentiate teams based on jersey colors.

- 🥅 **Goal Event Highlighting** *(placeholder)*  
  Flag possible goal events using ball and net proximity detection.

- 🔥 **Player Heatmap Generation**  
  Visualize player movement density across the pitch during a match.
